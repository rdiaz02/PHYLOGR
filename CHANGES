Version 1.0.1. 2001/12/22
- Fixes in documentation (prompted by release 1.4.0 of R).

Version 1.0.  2001/03/25 and 2001/04/30
- Added read.phylip.data.
- Modified read.sim.data to allow for PHYLIP formated files.

Version 0.91. 2000/11/07
- Fixed problem with ask=T in plot methods.
- Fixed missing links in documentation.

Version 0.9.  2000/10/30
- Changed to allow PHYLOGR to run under both R-1.1.1 and R-devel (the future R-1.2.0):
	there were some scoping problems in lm.phylog with things that
	worked under R-1.1.1 but not R-1.2.0.
- Done more testing. Everything seems to work just fine; I think we are ready
	for 1.0 (but being overly cautious...).

Version 0.2.  2000/10/09
- Changed files icfxx.fic, icfxx.pdi, icfxx.sim (log10 of clutch frequency).
- Changed var-cov files (dsc and derived *.varcov); they are no longer scaled.
- Documented all data files and a few previously undocumented functions (helper functions).
- Changed paper-code.R to accomodate changes in ms.
